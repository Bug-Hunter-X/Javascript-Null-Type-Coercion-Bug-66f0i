This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to null type coercion when performing addition. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version. The issue lies in the handling of null values within the addition operation.  The problem is described in detail within the files.  Understanding this edge case is crucial for writing robust JavaScript code.
